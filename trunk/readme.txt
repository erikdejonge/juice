New in 2.2
----------

1. iPodder -> Juice name change

2. Expanded support for various one-click subscription mechanisms.
   On Windows: a File Types tab in Preferences to set these behaviors.

3. Clipboard support for feed/podcast URLs on Windows/Mac

4. Winamp support for playing and enqueuing files. (Windows only)

5. User guide, linked from Start -> iPodder -> UserGuide on Windows.

6. Downloaded files are named after the final URL instead of the
   initial URL when HTTP redirects are encountered.

7. Enriched the history data we save, to allow us to support a number of
   new features.  For example, script-powered download URLs should work
   now.

8. The history database cleans up after itself, deleting history
   records for items that are both old and no longer present in
   the feed.

9. Allow re-downloading files that have gone missing by marking
   them as Removed.

10. New languages: Danish, Basque, Finnish, Italian, Korean, Greek

11. Added support for password-protected proxies (HTTP Basic and Digest).

12. Added support for password-protected feeds and downloads
   (HTTP Basic and Digest).  Please note: protected downloads must live
   on the same domain as the feed in order for this to work.

13. Download code now respects content-disposition header for download
   files whose names are different than the URL at which they're located.

14. Fixed BitTorrent abort/resume.  Partially downloaded BitTorrents now
   show up with Partial status instead of Downloaded.

15. Fixed a bug in Windows Media Player support that resulte in Date Added
   not getting set.  Date-based auto-playlists work now.

16. Feedmanager OPML fetcher now runs in a background thread unless we're
   about to do a download run.

17. Directory root for newly added directories, where we'll put
    directories that haven't yet been added to the stable release.

18. Moved scheduler configuration data into ipodder.cfg

19. Minor refactors: moved iPodder.py to ipodder/core.py,
    moved iPodderWindows.py to the gui directory.

20. Python24 compatibility fixes (ongoing)


------------------

BASIC INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Launch iPodder

2. Add podcast feeds.

a. Option 1.  Copy/paste podcast feed URLs into the text input box on the
   Status tab and click Add Feed.
   
b. Option 2.  Click on the Directory tab.  Navigate the tree
   by clicking or double-clicking on the name of the directory or the folder icons. 

   Podcast feeds will have a orange dash icon next to them.  When you select a
   feed, its URL will appear at the bottom of the window.  Add the feed
   to your subscriptions by clicking Add.  It should show up in the main
   subscriptions window with state "newly-subscribed".

3. Set scheduler options

A bit of magic happens when you pick up your MP3 player and fresh content
is already there waiting for you.  Use iPodder to schedule automatic downloads
by entering the times you'd like it to run in the Tools -> Scheduler menu option.
First check the box next to "Enable scheduler".  If you'd like
iPodder to run at specific times, select the "Check at these specific times" radio
button and enter the specific times.  If you plan to listen to podcasts on
your morning commute, you might set iPodder to perform downloads a few hours
before you leave.  Alternatively, you can set iPodder to run at regular
intervals.  Select the interval from the "Repeat every" menu.  Finally, click
"Save and Close" to apply the settings.

4. Walk away

Well, not literally.  But do hide or minimize iPodder and forget about it for
a while.  Based on your scheduler settings, iPodder will check for and download
new content and transfer it to your iTunes or Windows Media Player.  Of course
if you'd like you can check for new podcasts at any time, just be prepared to
stare the download progress bar for a bit.  

5. Listen!

When you're ready to listen, sync your MP3 player and you're on your way.
If you're running Windows and leave your iPod connected, iPodder will
automatically sync it after finishing its downloads.

6. Power user tip

To help manage the volume of new content, we suggest using your music management
software to create a smart playlist of the last N songs added.


IF UPGRADING FROM 1.1 through 2.0.5:

Nothing to say here.

IF UPGRADING FROM 1.0:

Windows: Ideally everything went well and your existing settings were migrated by
the installer.  Keep reading if your settings were lost.  In iPodder 1.0 the settings
were stored in the iPodder installation directory, probably
C:\Program Files\iPodder.  Starting with version 1.1 the configuration are placed outside
the installation directory, in a user-specific directory, if possible.  The default location
is the NT-style Application directory, usually
C:\Documents and Settings\yourname\Application Data\iPodder.  If your settings were lost,
try locating these three files in the previous installation directory and copying them to
the new configuration directory: favorites.txt, history.txt, schedule.txt.

Mac: Ideally everything went well and your existing settings were migrated by
the installer.  Keep reading if your settingswere lots.  In iPodder 1.0 the
settings were stored in the iPodder installation directory, probably
/Applications/iPodder.  Starting with 1.1 the configuration files are placed
outside the installation directory, in a user-specific directory, if possible.
The default location is /Users/yourname/.iPodder.  Note that this directory
will be hidden in the finder because it begins with a (.).  You may navigate
directory to this folder by selecting Go from the Finder menu and typing in
the folder location.  If your settings were lost, try locating these three 
files in the previous installation directory and copying them to the new
configuration directory: favorites.txt, history.txt, schedule.txt.
