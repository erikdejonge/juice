Done:

* gui*, except for references to iPodderX
* All the loggers
* hiPodder.py

Places where we still have to get rid of iPods: 

* docs/* 
* win32/setup.py where it refers to docs/*
* win32/oneclick.py registry key names -- need to be a little clever
* win32/hiPodder*

We also need to change, on the web site: 

* ipodder-users.xml to juice-users.xml
* opml/ipodder.opml to juice.opml

Fun tip:

* In GVIM, search (/) for: [^. ]ipod
