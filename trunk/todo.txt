[ 1064105 ] Filter by MIME types
[ 1061152 ] iPodder fails to set grouping on new Podcasts
1054400	Fix feed and enclosure counts - gtk (50% done)
1053402	installer issue: Add version number an properties to the file.
1043941	WinAmp support
1047244	Set genre on downloaded podcasts
1045367	Proxy support
1043958	More traybar icon states
* Feed-specific conversion of content to preferred encoding formats to
  save space, particularly for those with smaller media players. 
* Conversion to Apple's format and changing the extension from w4a to
  w4b so iPods will think a long broadcast is an audio book and keep a
  bookmark. 
* Over-riding a show's crummy ID3 tags with tags that make sense.
